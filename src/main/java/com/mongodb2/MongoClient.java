/**
 * <p>A MongoDB client with internal connection pooling. For most applications, you should have one MongoClient instance for the entire
 * JVM.
 * <p>The following are equivalent, and all connect to the local database running on the default port:</p>
 * <pre>
 * MongoClient mongoClient1 = new MongoClient();
 * MongoClient mongoClient1 = new MongoClient("localhost");
 * MongoClient mongoClient2 = new MongoClient("localhost", 27017);
 * MongoClient mongoClient4 = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress("localhost"));
 * MongoClient mongoClient5 = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress("localhost"), new MongoClientOptions.Builder().build());
 * </pre>
 * <p>You can connect to a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica+Sets">replica set</a> using the Java driver by passing a
 * ServerAddress list to the MongoClient constructor. For example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(Arrays.asList(
 *   new ServerAddress("localhost", 27017),
 *   new ServerAddress("localhost", 27018),
 *   new ServerAddress("localhost", 27019)));
 * </pre>
 * <p>You can connect to a sharded cluster using the same constructor.  MongoClient will auto-detect whether the servers are a list of
 * replica set members or a list of mongos servers.</p>
 *
 * <p>By default, all read and write operations will be made on the primary, but it's possible to read from secondaries by changing the read
 * preference:</p>
 * <pre>
 * mongoClient.setReadPreference(ReadPreference.secondaryPreferred());
 * </pre>
 * <p>By default, all write operations will wait for acknowledgment by the server, as the default write concern is {@code
 * WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: This class supersedes the {@code Mongo} class.  While it extends {@code Mongo}, it differs from it in that the default write
 * concern is to wait for acknowledgment from the server of all write operations.  In addition, its constructors accept instances of {@code
 * MongoClientOptions} and {@code MongoClientURI}, which both also set the same default write concern.</p>
 *
 * <p>In general, users of this class will pick up all of the default options specified in {@code MongoClientOptions}.  In particular, note
 * that the default value of the connectionsPerHost option has been increased to 100 from the old default value of 10 used by the superseded
 * {@code Mongo} class.</p>
 *
 * @see ReadPreference#primary()
 * @see com.mongodb2.WriteConcern#ACKNOWLEDGED
 * @see MongoClientOptions
 * @see MongoClientURI
